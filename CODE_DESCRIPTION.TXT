MEM.CPP - Optionally provides extensive memory-use checking as a debugging tool.
READFILE.CPP - Several variable analysis programs use this to read data files
SPEARMAN.CPP - Compute Spearman rho nonparametric correlation
STATS.CPP - A wide variety of statistical routines.  Very useful for other applications as well!

The following routines compute mutual information and relatives

MUTINF_B.CPP - Mutual information for binary data
MUTINF_C.CPP - Mutual information for continuous data
MUTINF_D.CPP - Mutual information for discrete data
TRANS_ENT.CPP - Transfer entropy (information transfer)


The following routines are primitive models used by testing programs.
These use minimal training and do no error checking, so they are not
appropriate for use outside of these applications.

LINREG.CPP - Ordinary linear regression by singular value decomposition

MLFN.CPP - Multiple layer feedforward network
LOGISTIC.CPP - Logistic regression limited to small positive weights
